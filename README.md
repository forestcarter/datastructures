This project is a playground for learning new technologies: 

##  1. Typescript
I finally understand what the benefits are. Type checking actually does save time!

##  2. TDD with Jest and Enzyme 
I'm learning the patterns of testing, I'm looking forward to weeing how this approach improves my development flow.

##  3. Data Structures
It's fun implementing these in Javascript, it gets me thinking about when they might be beneficial over built in JS structures. 

##  4. GraphQL 
I'm liking the structure and specificity of graph querying compared to a traditional HTTP API

##  5. NodeJS with Express 
I learned this server tech a couple of years ago, but I'm looking forward to revisiting it and comparing with Apache.
